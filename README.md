# Hotel management project in OPERATING SYSTEMS uni course

In this group project, we were asked to program a client-server application for hotel bookings. 

Server:
- Stores information for each hotel (name, location, rating, list of rooms).
- Categorizes hotel rooms based on number of beds and stores information for each room (description, price per night, number of beds, booking details).

Client:
- Chooses hotel from given list (by server).
- Can book a new room in said hotel, display booked rooms or empty rooms, view all hotel rooms, clear a booking or search for a room based on price or number of beds.

The client code is only responsible for the connection to the server and any user input - all hotel management details are stored in the server code.
